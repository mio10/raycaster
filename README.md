# Raycaster

![](preview.gif)

## Description
A small 2D ray casting demo programmed in [Processing](https://processing.org), a Java-based platform designed for simple computer graphics. 

## Requirements
[Processing](https://processing.org)

Full HD screen resolution is recommended because wall positions are hardcoded.

## Quick start
### Windows
*(may also work on Linux but wasn't tested)*
```console
$ processing-java --sketch=path/to/raycaster --run
```
**Note:** `path/to/raycaster` is a path to the directory containing `raycaster.pde`.
