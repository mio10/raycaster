# Raycaster

## Description
A small self-found ray casting demo programmed in [Processing](https://processing.org), a Java-based platform designed for simple computer graphics. 

The 'self-found' means that at the time when I was writing this demo app I didn't have prior knowledge about how ray casting alghorithms work. This was intentional because I wanted to implement the thing myself.

## Requirements
[Processing](https://processing.org)

## Quick start
### Windows
*(may also work on Linux but wasn't tested)*
```console
$ processing-java --sketch=<path_to_your_raycaster_directory> --run
```
